# MeetMe-Calendar-Web-App
This is a calendar application very similar to Doodle, it can help you arrange metings, sync with your Google Calendar, add events to your
both MeetMe Calendar and Google Calendar, invite participants to your meetings using very robust UI. You can also delete such events and meetings,
You can edit both meetings and events. You can even use drag-drop type calendar to arrange times for your events.
  This application was programmed using Python's web framework 'Django' on the backend, Html,Css,JS stack for the front end. It is designed using
  MVT(Model View Template) architecture for the whole application. It's essential part is it sends e-mails to users directly to inform them
  for actions done by both other users and automated reminders for deciding and voting on events. User can vote on time options created by the creator
  during the creation of the meeting. Creator can see which option has more votes and can decide based on that. When meeting is decided it is directly
  pushed onto calendars of participants and creator as a event which has time frame based on what the creator has decided. It also supports
  reccurring events like Google Calendar. You can register to the application by giving your username-email-password and activate your account
  using activation e-mail which is sent to you as soon as you register. Than you can login to your account using information which you registered with.
  
  Instructions on how to setup a server instance of this application will be announced later.
